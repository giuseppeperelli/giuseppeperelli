My research interests regard many aspects of **Formal Methods for Artificial Intelligence**. In particular, I work on verification and synthesis for multi-agent systems, knowledge representation, strategic reasoning, logics, games, and automata theory.
In 2023, I received the ["Marco Somalvico" Young Researcher Award](https://www.di.uniroma1.it/it/notizie/riconoscimenti/premio-marco-somalvico-giuseppe-perelli) from the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence as best under 37 Italian researchers who autonomously contributed to advance the state-of-the-art in the field.
In 2012, I received the 3+2 Award from the Italian Association for Logics and its Applications for Best Master Thesis in Logics.
